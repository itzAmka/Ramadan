					<p class="explaination">
						Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and is
						considered the holiest month of the year for Muslims around the
						world. During this month, Muslims observe a month-long period of
						fasting, prayer, and reflection.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						Fasting during Ramadan is an important religious practice for
						Muslims. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is mandatory for
						all healthy, adult Muslims who are not traveling. However, pregnant
						and menstruating women are exempt from fasting. During Ramadan,
						Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity from
						sunrise until sunset every day.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						The purpose of fasting is to help Muslims develop self-discipline,
						self-control, and empathy for those who are less fortunate. By
						abstaining from food and drink during the day, Muslims are reminded
						of the suffering of those who live in poverty and do not have access
						to basic necessities.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						Ramadan is also a time for increased spiritual reflection and
						worship. Muslims are encouraged to read the Quran more frequently,
						perform additional prayers, and engage in acts of charity and
						kindness towards others.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						The end of Ramadan is marked by the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a
						festive holiday during which Muslims gather to pray, give gifts, and
						share meals with one another.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						In summary, Ramadan is a month-long period of fasting, prayer, and
						reflection that is considered the holiest month of the year for
						Muslims. Fasting is mandatory for all healthy, adult Muslims, and
						the purpose is to develop self-discipline, self-control, and empathy
						for those who are less fortunate. Ramadan is also a time for
						increased spiritual reflection and worship, and it ends with the
						celebration of Eid al-Fitr.

				<h2>Who is not fasting?</h2>
				<div class="explainations">
					<p class="explaination">
						There are certain groups of people who are exempt from fasting
						during Ramadan, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span>Children who have not reached puberty:</span>
							Children are not required to fast until they reach puberty,
							although many children may choose to fast for part of the day to
							practice.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Pregnant and breastfeeding women: </span>
							Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are exempt from fasting if
							they fear that it may harm their health or the health of their
							child. However, they are encouraged to make up the missed fasts at
							a later time, if possible. Women who are menstruating are also
							exempt from fasting during Ramadan, as fasting during this time
							may be particularly challenging. They can choose to make up the
							missed fasts at a later time, when they are no longer
							menstruating.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Elderly people and those with chronic illnesses:</span>
							People who are elderly or have chronic illnesses that may be
							worsened by fasting are also exempt. However, if they are able to
							fast without harming their health, they are encouraged to do so.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span>Travelers:</span> Muslims who are traveling long distances
							are also exempt from fasting, although they are encouraged to make

			<section id="miss-fasting" class="content">
				<h2>What happens if you miss a day or more than a day?</h2>
				<div class="explainations">
					<p class="explaination">
						If a Muslim misses one or more days of fasting during Ramadan due to
						a valid reason, such as illness, travel, or menstruation, they are
						allowed to make up those missed fasts at a later time. Muslims are
						required to make up any missed fasts before the next Ramadan comes,
						as it is considered a religious obligation to complete the required
						number of fasts.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						If a Muslim misses a day or more of fasting during Ramadan without a
						valid reason, then they have committed a sin and are required to
						make up those missed fasts as soon as possible. In addition, they
						are encouraged to seek forgiveness from Allah and make a sincere
						effort to complete the required number of fasts as soon as possible.
					</p>
					<p class="explaination">
						It is important to note that missing a day or more of fasting during
						Ramadan without a valid reason is considered a serious matter in
						Islam, and Muslims are encouraged to do their best to avoid such a
						situation. However, if a valid reason does arise, such as illness or
						travel, then Muslims are allowed to make up those missed fasts at a
						later time.
