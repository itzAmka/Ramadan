                  Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and
                  is considered the holiest month of the year for Muslims around
                  the world. During this month, Muslims observe a month-long
                  period of fasting, prayer, and reflection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Fasting during Ramadan is an important religious practice for
                  Muslims. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is
                  mandatory for all healthy, adult Muslims who are not
                  traveling. However, pregnant and menstruating women are exempt
                  from fasting. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food,
                  drink, smoking, and sexual activity from sunrise until sunset
                  every day.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ramadan is a time for increased spiritual reflection and
                  worship. Muslims are encouraged to read the Quran more
                  frequently, perform additional prayers, and engage in acts of
                  charity and kindness towards others.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>The purpose of fasting</strong> is to help Muslims
                  develop self-discipline, self-control, and empathy for those
                  who are less fortunate. By abstaining from food and drink
                  during the day, Muslims are reminded of the suffering of those
                  who live in poverty and do not have access to basic
                  necessities.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The end of Ramadan is marked by the celebration of Eid
                  al-Fitr, a festive holiday during which Muslims gather to
                  pray, give gifts, and share meals with one another.
